March of Empires
================


March of Empires is a token-heavy deck based on 'March of the Multitudes' Modern Event deck. In this deck it is mostly about soldiers.

I mostly play it in Forge. For this reason it contains two different version of each Planeswalker, Gideon and Elspeth, to unlock achievements.
